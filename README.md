#Assignment 3 - Self-Implemented Singly Linked List

A self- implementation of a singly linked list written in java. This program is Assignment 3 for CS-357: Data Structures at Eastern New Mexico University, Spring 2020.

The specs for this assignment are [here](../Assignment_3_CS357_Spring_2020.pdf). I used Eclipse IDE for this program. I originally didn't realize the .gitignore doesn't remove extra ecplise files and directories. These can be ignored. The core is in the ```src``` directory.
